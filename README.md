## Developer notes
The following is a small retrospective by the team after release 1.0.0:
    One rewarding element from developing this application was pushing ourselves to be conscious of security practices and possible vulnerabiities specific to a password manager app while doing so. We've had previous experience with web development, but the majority of the focus was on web development practices and technology rather than a combination of that and security.
    A challenge and yet another new experience for the team was implementing dynamic analysis, which was done using [Iroh](https://github.com/maierfelix/Iroh). We've had experience with static analysis using ESLint, but it was relatively easier since we did not needed to take extra steps to conduct static analyses.
